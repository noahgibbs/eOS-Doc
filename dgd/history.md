# What is DGD's History?

DGD's language is called LPC ("[Lars Pensj√∂](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Pensj%C3%B6) C"), which is also the language of a type of highly-programmable old mass-multiplayer text games called [LPMuds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPMud).

DGD was initially an LPMUD, which later added more powerful features as a programming language, and then shed the original LPMUD game features. It started out as a game scripting language, and became a more general scripting language.

You'll see this reflected in some of DGD's vocabulary. For instance, the "Kernellib" was often originally called the Kernel MUDLib, named after MUDs such as LPMud. Current DGD tends to use common vocabulary (users, network ports, etc.) but you'll see holdovers such as the "wiztool" for staff/creator commands.
